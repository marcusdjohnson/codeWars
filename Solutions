Challenge:
The two oldest ages function/method needs to be completed. It should take an array of numbers as its argument and return the two highest numbers within the array. The returned value should be an array in the format [second oldest age, oldest age].

The order of the numbers passed in could be any order. The array will always include at least 2 items. If there are two or more oldest age, then return both of them in array format.

Solution:
def two_oldest_ages(ages):
    #your code here
    sortedAges = ages.sort()
    oldest_Ages = [ages[-2],ages[-1]]
    return oldest_Ages
    
    
Challenge:
Your team is writing a fancy new text editor and you've been tasked with implementing the line numbering.

Write a function which takes a list of strings and returns each line prepended by the correct number.

The numbering starts at 1. The format is n: string. Notice the colon and space in between.

Solution:
def number(lines):
    #your code here
    counter = 1
    output = []
    
    for line in lines:
        output.append('{}: {}'.format(counter, line))
        counter += 1
        
    return output
